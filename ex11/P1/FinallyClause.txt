1. Why does the program print the two lines below?
(1) Exception occurred
(2) in finally clause
A.In the second iteration of the loop, the line if (++count == 2) throw new Exception(); 
is executed. Here, ++count increases the value of count to 2. As a result, 
an exception is thrown by the throw new Exception(); statement.
The exception is caught by the catch block and the message "(2) Exception occurred" is printed.
After the exception is caught, the program enters the finally block and the message "(2) in finally clause" is printed.
Thus, these two lines are output.

2. Why does the program print the line below (It looks like the program does not print the line because
of the break statement)?
(3) in finally clause
A.After the exception is thrown in the previous iteration and caught, the program executes the finally block, 
which outputs the message "(2) in finally clause". The code then reaches the break; statement and exits the loop.
Before exiting the loop, the program executes the finally block again, and the message "(3) in finally clause" is printed.
Thus, the finally block is executed and the line is output even though a break statement exists.

3. Why does the program print the line below?
Main program ends
A.After the loop is terminated by the break statement, 
the program continues to execute and reaches the line System.out.println("Main program ends");.
This line is outside the loop and is not affected by any exceptions or conditional statements.
Therefore, this line is printed, indicating the end of the main program.
