1. 3 oreration is implicit cast.

2. 3 above are explicit cast.

3. Since the Point class is a superclass of the MovingPoint class, 
   an object reference of type Point can refer to an object of type MovingPoint.

4.In operation 3, we need to convert the type of o2 to MovingPoint by casting o2 to o3 and then assign it. 
  Converting an object reference of type Point to type MovingPoint requires an explicit cast.
